This mod enables use of A19 address line to switch two 512kB banks of 1MB Flash on board of DFB1 to have dual boot. 

The mod is using Options1 jumper which was repurposed from selecting 64/128MB Fast RAM size to switching Flash ROM boot banks.

To bypass 64/128MB Option1 switch, I created two separate .jed files to flash in CPLD with 64MB or 128MB RAM installed on the DFB1 board. 

With this mod Option1 jumper allows to switch banks. It can be wired to external switch for user convenience.
